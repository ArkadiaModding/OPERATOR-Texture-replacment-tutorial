<p>Open UABEANext</a> and open folders by using files -> open folder or ctrl + shift + o</p>
<p>Locate your OPERATOR folder: right-click OPERATOR, and then manage -> Browse local files.</p>
<p>All the files should be in OPERATOR_Data -> StreamingAssets-> aa -> StandaloneWindows64. (it will probably take sometime to load)</p>

<p>Find the .bundle/assset where the texture you want to replace is at(red)</p>
